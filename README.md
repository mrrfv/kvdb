# kvdb

Very simple postgres-based key-value database server.

## Why?

Firebase, Appwrite, Supabase and other similar services have limited free plans, usually based around the amount of daily reads, writes or simultaneous connections. This is a problem for projects with no budget that need to store a small amount of data that is accessed or modified very frequently.

By using this project, you can host your own key-value database server, with no limits on reads, writes or connections. The only limit is the amount of storage space available on your server.

## Features

- Very simple API
- Meant to be directly connected to from the client, no additional backend needed
- **No authentication (key name is considered secret)** - please keep this in mind when using this project
- Optional response speed throttling
- Optional key expiration
- Key/value length limits
- Read-only keys that respond with the same value but don't allow writes
- CORS support

## Usage

### Requirements

- PostgreSQL database
- Node.js 18+ and npm

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit it to match your database configuration
4. Run `node db-setup.js` to create the database table. Define the `DANGEROUS_DELETE_TABLE` environment variable to delete the existing table first (this will delete all data).
5. Run `node index.js` to start the server

### HTTP API

#### GET /key?name=KEY_NAME

Returns the value of the key `KEY_NAME`.

**Response example:**

```json
{
  "value": "Hello, world!"
}
```

#### POST /key

**Request body:**

```json
{
  "name": "Optional key name"
}
```

**Response example:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "name": "Key name",
  "name_readonly": "Read-only key name",
}
```

Creates a key. An optional key name can be specified in a `name` JSON parameter. If no name is specified, a secure random string will be used. The key name must contain no spaces or special characters. `roname` is the name of the read-only key that is created alongside the regular key.

If a key is invalid, the server will generate a new key name and return it in the response.

#### PATCH /key

**Request body:**

```json
{
  "name": "Key name",
  "value": "New value"
}
```

**Response example:**

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

Updates the value of the key `KEY_NAME` to `NEW_VALUE`.

#### DELETE /key?name=KEY_NAME

**Response example:**

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

Deletes the key `KEY_NAME`.
